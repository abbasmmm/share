Scalability: MFEs enable independent development and deployment, facilitating the addition of new features or sections to your application as it grows.

Modularity: Each MFE functions as a self-contained module, enhancing maintainability and reducing code conflicts.

Team Independence: Different teams can work on separate MFEs, fostering team autonomy and speeding up development.

Flexibility: The architecture easily adapts to changing requirements, ensuring long-term sustainability.

Enhanced User Experience: Dynamic loading ensures faster initial page loads and responsive navigation, elevating the user experience.

Reduced Risk: Isolating functionality in MFEs limits the impact of issues, minimizing the risk of application-wide failures.

Simplified Maintenance: MFEs are easier to maintain and update, with changes in one module having minimal impact on others.

Optimized Resource Usage: Dynamic loading and shared dependencies result in efficient resource utilization and reduced data transfer.
