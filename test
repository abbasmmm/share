Monolithic UI and Services Layer: Our journey began with a monolithic architecture, where the user interface and services layer were tightly coupled. This architecture had served us well initially, but as our team and codebase continued to grow, it became increasingly challenging to manage.

Testing and Maintenance Challenges: With the increasing complexity of our monolithic application, testing and maintaining the codebase became a formidable task. The tight integration between different parts of the application made it difficult to isolate issues and implement changes without affecting other components.

Scalability Concerns: As we sought to scale our application and development teams, the monolithic structure proved to be a bottleneck. It hindered our agility and the ability to release features independently, slowing down our time-to-market.

Codebase Growth: The growth of our codebase made it essential to find a more manageable and scalable architecture. It became evident that we needed a solution that would allow us to work on individual features independently, improve maintainability, and enhance overall development efficiency.

The Need for a New Approach: Faced with these challenges, we embarked on a journey to transform our monolithic architecture into a more agile and scalable solution. Our quest for a better way led us to Micro Frontends with Webpack 5 Module Federation, a paradigm that promised to address our issues and open new possibilities for our development process.
