Individual Micro Frontends (MFEs):

Diverse Functionality: Each individual micro frontend focuses on specific business functionality or features. Different teams are responsible for these micro frontends, which are isolated and independently deployable.

Common-Lib (Shared Business Logic Library):

Shared Business Logic: Common-Lib contains a library of shared business logic, including validation rules, data formatters, and other essential functions. This logic is shared across multiple micro frontends.

Helios (Reusable Component Library):

Reusable Components: Helios serves as a repository of reusable, generic components that are utilized across the entire application. This ensures consistency and reduces redundancy in component development.
Styling and Theming Control: Helios manages styling and theme-specific changes, allowing for a unified look and feel throughout the application. It helps maintain a consistent visual identity across micro frontends.
Efficiency: By centralizing component management and styling, Helios streamlines the development process and minimizes the risk of visual inconsistencies.

FusionRD (Container Application):

Container for Micro Frontends: FusionRD acts as the container application, initially rendering the base application and then dynamically loading other micro frontends based on user actions. It orchestrates the integration of these micro frontends.
User-Driven Loading: The container responds to user interactions, loading the relevant micro frontend to provide a seamless, responsive user experience.
