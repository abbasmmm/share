Individual Micro Frontends (MFEs):

Individual MFEs each focus on specific functionality, developed by different teams and independently deployable. They use components from helios library and use shared logic from common-lib. 
Common-Lib (Shared Business Logic Library):

Common-Lib houses shared business logic, including validation rules and data formatters, essential for multiple micro frontends.


Helios (Reusable Component Library):

Helios is a repository of reusable, generic components used across the application, ensuring consistent styling, theming, and development efficiency.




FusionRD (Container Application):

FusionRD serves as the container application, rendering the base app and dynamically loading micro frontends in response to user actions, ensuring a seamless, responsive user experience.
